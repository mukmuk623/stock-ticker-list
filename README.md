About
-----

I've taken the smallest part of an existing local project and opened it up to you. I have only entertained US-based stock tickers.


Future

If you get excited and want to add to this, please move forward by adding a country column using the (2-letter top-level-domain abbreviation) followed by the company ticker and name.
